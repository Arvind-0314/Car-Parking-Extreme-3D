## Car-Parking-Extreme-3D

# Description
This is a 3D car parking game developed in Unity where players control a car and attempt to park it accurately in a designated zone while avoiding obstacles. The game includes intuitive controls, a countdown timer, crash detection, and a scoring system based on time and collision performance. Upon successful parking, a success panel with the player's score is shown, and players can proceed to the level selection screen. If the player crashes or the timer runs out, the level restarts.
